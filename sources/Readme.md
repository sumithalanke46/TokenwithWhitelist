# Token with Blacklist

## Project Description

This smart contract implements a comprehensive token management system with blacklist functionality and approval mechanisms for delegated transfers. The contract enables secure token operations while maintaining strict access control through blacklisting capabilities. It provides essential features for managing token allowances, ensuring that only authorized and non-blacklisted addresses can participate in token transfers and approvals.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a secure and compliant token management system that empowers organizations and individuals to maintain strict control over token transfers while enabling flexible delegation mechanisms. By combining blacklist functionality with approval systems, we aim to provide a robust foundation for regulatory compliance and enhanced security in decentralized finance applications.

The contract serves as a building block for applications requiring:
- Regulatory compliance through address restrictions
- Secure delegation of transfer rights
- Transparent and auditable token operations
- Protection against malicious actors through blacklisting
